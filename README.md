## About The Projects

Within the repository, you will find two projects, each accompanied by a fully detailed document outlining their objectives and methodologies and along with runnable R code scripts. The overall purpose of the projects is to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in R programming and statistical analysis. In the first project focused on secondary education, I skillfully merged two datasets stored as .CSV files and conducted a comprehensive array of statistical tests to assess my hypotheses. These tests encompassed means testing, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), correlational analysis, and linear regression.As for the COVID-19 project, I adeptly leveraged R's ggplot2 library to craft a range of visually compelling graphs that effectively conveyed the insights gleaned from the datasets. Overall, both projects exemplify my capabilities in utilizing R for data manipulation, statistical examination, and data visualization to yield valuable and informative results.
